# Magnetstein: NMR spectra analysis tool
![main_workflow_final](https://github.com/BDomzal/magnetstein/assets/65540968/f3c35cfb-e996-4f2a-b01b-3007a7676bd0)

This repository contains software tools which allow to compare nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and solve quantification task, i.e. estimate amounts of components in a mixture using the Wasserstein distance. Find out more [here.](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c03594)

Magnetstein is a modification of the algorithm from a Python3 package dedicated for mass spectrometry, called `masserstein` (available [here](https://github.com/mciach/masserstein)). 

If you encounter any difficulties during installation or usage of these programs, or if you have any suggestions regarding their functionality, please post a GitHub issue or send an email to b.domzal@mimuw.edu.pl. 

# About the method

### When to use Magnetstein

The method demonstrates its full potential when:

- peaks shift (i.e. the positions of peaks are different in mixture's spectrum as opposed to single component's spectrum),
- peaks from different components overlap,
- lineshapes are distorted,
- resolution is low or differs between spectra,
- spectra contain peaks from different solvents,
- there are contaminations and/or noise.
  
In such circumstances, the Magnetstein algorithm gains an advantage over other tools due to the special properties of the Wasserstein metric that is the core concept of the method. The metric makes the algorithm robust to changes in peaks' locations and shapes, and to ambiguity in assigning signal to particular components due to overlap. The additional refinements make it possible for the algorithm to remove noise from the data.

### What to use as an input

The input should consist of the two crucial parts:

- mixture's spectrum,
- library, i.e. a set of spectra of individual components expected to be present in the mixture.

### How to interpret and set the values of the parameters

The user can optionally define the values of two parameters: $\kappa_{mixture}$ (a.k.a. `MTD`, Maximum Transport Distance) and $\kappa_{components}$ (a.k.a. `MTD_th`). These are so-called *denoising penalties* that can be interpreted as soft tolerance thresholds for shifting of the signal along the horizontal axis for the spectrum of the mixture and for the spectra in the library, respectively. Another interpretation is viewing $\kappa_{mixture}$ as a certain measure of reliability of the mixture's spectrum. The higher its value, the less likely the algorithm is to remove noise from the spectrum. Similarly, $\kappa_{components}$ reflects our confidence in the purity of the spectra in the library.

If you are unsure about how to set the parameters, we recommend using default values $\kappa_{mixture}=0.25$ and $\kappa_{components}=0.22$. We checked experimentally that such settings produced accurate results for many datasets.

### How to interpret the output

The main output of the algorithm is the list of values:

$$p = \Big(p_{1}, p_{2}, \dots, p_{k}\Big),$$

where $p_{i}$ is the *proportion* of the $i$-th component in the mixture. By *proportions* here we mean the relative amounts of components. Note that $p_{1} + p_{2} + \dots + p_{k}$ does not necessarily equal to 1 due to the presence of noise and contamination. The quantity $p_{0} := 1 - p_{1} - p_{2} - \dots - p_{k}$ is Magnetstein's estimation of the relative amount of the signal coming from the contamination in the mixture's spectrum. Similarly, the quantity $p'_{0}$, also returned by the algorithm, is the Magnestein's estimation of the relative amount of the signal coming from the contamination in the library.

### How to report the results

In order to make the results reproducible, one needs to provide: 1) input data (i.e. mixture's spectrum and library); 2) information about the parameters settings, i.e. chosen values of $\kappa_{mixture}$ and $\kappa_{components}$. This is enough to rerun the analysis.

# Web application

If you don't have programming experience, instead of this Python package you can use our [**web application**.](https://bioputer.mimuw.edu.pl/magnetstein) You can read more about it [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2025.102329).

If you prefer to use the Python package, proceed to Installation section.

# Installation

To be able to use the software provided in this repository, you will need to have a working Python3 distribution installed on your computer.  

To use Magnetstein, clone this repository. In the commandline, this can be done by typing:

```
git clone https://github.com/BDomzal/magnetstein.git
```

The above command will create a folder `magnetstein` in your current working directory. Go to this directory by typing

```
cd magnetstein/
```

in the commandline. Then, install the package by running the `setup.py` file:

```
python3 setup.py install --user
```

This will install the `masserstein` package for the current user (including NMR spectroscopy tool Magnetstein).  

You will also need to have the following packages installed (all available via pip):

* `IsoSpecPy`
* `numpy`
* `scipy`
* `PuLP`

(For example: if you would like to install pulp, you need to type

```
pip install PuLP
```

in the commandline.)

If you are a researcher, we recommend using Gurobi (available for academics at no cost) as your solver in Magnetstein. For more information on license and installation, see [Gurobi website](https://www.gurobi.com/). Gurobi is a default solver. If you prefer to use Magnetstein without Gurobi, set `solver=LpSolverDefault` in `estimate_proportions` function. Note that using Magnetstein with unreliable solver can result in long computation time and, in some cases, incorrect results.

# Example: quantification for a single mixture

See `estimation.ipynb` in folder `examples/` to find out how to estimate amounts of components in a single NMR mixture. If you need more example data, check out [this repository](https://github.com/BDomzal/magnetstein_data).

# Monitoring chemical reactions

Magnetstein enables also the analysis of multiple mixtures, for example obtained from reaction monitoring. This utility is available via function `estimate_proportions_in_time`. To see examples, visit this [repository](https://github.com/BDomzal/magnetstein_x_chemical_reactions). Read more about it [here](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c00800).
