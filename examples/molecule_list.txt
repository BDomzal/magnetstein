# A list of molecules to deconvolve the spectrum in small_molecule_mixture.txt: ethanol, acetic acid and propane. 
# Additionally, ethene is present in the molecule list, but not in the spectrum.
# Note that after each element, a number needs to be present.
# For example, S1N2 is the correct way to indicate one sulfur and one nitrogen, while SN2 will be interpreted as two atoms of tin.
